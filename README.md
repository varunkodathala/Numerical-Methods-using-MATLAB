## Hi everyone!

This Link is built to model the numerical methods simulation using MATLAB 
The models discussed in this module are
1. Bisection Method 
- The Arithmetic Mean
- Root Mean Square
- The decimal approximation
- The Iterative Approximation
- RMS and Mean Average
2. False Position Method <br> <br>
3. Secant Method<br> <br>
4. Newton Iterative Method <br> <br>
5. False Position + Secant <br> <br>
6. Newton Iterative + Bisection <br> <br>
7. Exponential Method <br> <br>
8. Secant + Bisection <br> <br>
9. Circuit Solution using linspace <br> <br>
10. Gauss Elimination Method<br>
<br>
I included the file range measurement function which is optional and it is optimized in two ways.<br>
1. range_calc <br>
2. range_equation
<br>
These two functions return range of equation (l,u) such that f(l)*f(u)<0 <br>
<br>
This range is used for further evaluation of methods like Bisection, False Position, etc.<br>
<br>
So it is mandatory to download the folder range calculation to evaluate the remaining functions. <br>
<br>
Make sure you Do this before actual execution<br>
<br>
This section is repeatedly updated with new files....please be up to date!!!
